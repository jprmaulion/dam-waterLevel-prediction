# Dam Water Level Data Analysis and Prediction

In this notebook, exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the measurements of water storage and discharge from the Three Gorges Dam in Yichang, Hubei, China will be conducted. Forecasts of upstream water levels in the dam will also be performed using MLP- and LSTM-based machine learning models. Forecasting performance will also be analyzed.


This notebooks is divided into three sections: (1) Data cleaning, (2) exploratory data analysis, and (3) ML modeling. The notebook will be continuously improved by incorporating other machine learning methods and/or adding another EDA method.
